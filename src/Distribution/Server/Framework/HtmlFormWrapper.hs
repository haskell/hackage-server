-- | There is a bit of a conflict in the design of a REST api due to the need
-- to support both web browsers and machine clients using machine formats like
-- JSON.
--
-- For machine clients we want a nice set of separate resources using JSON and
-- GET\/PUT\/POST\/DELETE.
--
-- For web browsers we want nice pages that aggregate multiple aspects and that
-- use only POST with @multipart\/form-data@. One problem is that these use
-- different resource types: browsers want HTML and form-data, while other
-- clients want JSON or other machine formats. Another problem is that humans
-- want nice pages that aggregate multiple bits into a single resource, while
-- machine clients want separate single-purpose resources. In addition, the
-- stage changes from resource to resource when doing updates is different.
-- A web browser wants to POST to modify some data and then see either the new
-- data (again an aggregate human-oriented page) or to see an updated view of
-- the same page, while the other clients simply want to know if the update was
-- successful and if it's a new resource then where it is.
--
-- Essentially we have two parts to the system: a web-based database in a nice
-- REST API style, and a separate human oriented website. We want both without
-- having to duplicate all the work. We can get much of the way there for GET
-- because we can simply have certain resources aimed only at humans, or only
-- at machines or in the overlap we can use content negotiation. For updates
-- though the clash is much worse: the classic HTML forms cannot make use of
-- a nice REST API.
--
-- There are a few solutions:
--
-- * make lots of resources accept POST and produce html results. This involves
--   many resources being duplicated in the html feature. This is the way
--   much of the server works now. It's ugly and duplicates things (or we miss
--   the human or machine side).
-- * use Ajax and have the web browser use the REST API directly. This is
--   actually rather attractive. The main REST API can be designed just for
--   machines and the web UI lives just in HTML pages that do all the PUT
--   DELETE etc directly.
-- * wrappers or workarounds for accessing the machine REST API via html forms
--   and POST. This involves the framework translating special form POST
--   requests into internal requests that are handled as if the were the simple
--   direct machine REST API.
--
-- The second option is certainly doable, though there is some prejudice
-- against JS amongst some of our userbase. It also requires our developers
-- to get familiar with JS & JS tech, e.g. jquery. Also, it doesn't have to be
-- all or nothing, can do it incrementally. This is a good longer term option.
--
-- Both options two and three meet the goal of letting most of the server
-- features handle only a simple machine REST API, reducing code duplication
-- and improving coverage of resources in machine formats.
--
-- This code implements the third option. We do a few translation steps, both
-- on the request and on the response. On the request side we deal with the
-- fact that HTML (and even HTML 5) can only perform POST requests, not PUT
-- or DELETE. We also deal with translating HTML @multipart\/form-data@ into
-- simple JSON. On the response side, we deal with the fact that an HTML page
-- that does a request wants to return to another HTML page, perhaps the same
-- one or a different one, while for the simple machine REST API the response
-- if often a simple acknowledgement.
--
-- To indicate that these translation wrappers are required we use a hidden
-- fields in the form. We use a @_method@ field to indicate that the POST
-- request should be translated. For the return location we use a @_return@
-- field.
