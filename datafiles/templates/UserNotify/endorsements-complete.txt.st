You have received all necessary endorsements, and have been added the the 'uploaders' group.

Packages that are uploaded to Hackage are generally expected to follow
the Package Versioning Policy and have version bounds on all
dependencies indicating which versions they are known to build with.
Here are some links that have more information:

https://hackage.haskell.org/upload#versioning_and_curation
https://pvp.haskell.org/

Also, here are a few things to keep in mind when uploading to Hackage
that help keep the ecosystem working reliably for everyone:

1. Hackage is intended to be a permanent record.  Therefore uploads
cannot be changed or removed.
2. Only upload things that work, are useful to other people, and that
you intend to maintain.
3. Use `cabal gen-bounds` to put PVP-compliant version bounds (lower
AND upper) on ALL your unique dependencies so your package will still
be buildable years down the road.  One important thing to note is that
you only need to include version bounds once.  For example, if you
depend on the same package in your library and your test suite, you
only need to put the version bounds for that dependency in one place.
This keeps the dependency bounds information DRY.
4. Package candidates CAN be changed, so use them to test things out
and get everything right before you publish permanently to the main
index.

Here are a few important resources where you can learn more:

Hackage packages:
