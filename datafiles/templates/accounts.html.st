<h2>Create an account</h2>

<p>To create an account, you should first <a href="/users/register-request">register a new user account</a> for yourself and then email <a href="mailto:admin@hackage.haskell.org">admin@hackage.haskell.org</a> to request upload privileges.</p>

<p>If you want to upload a new version for a package uploaded by another user, you should contact that user and request to be added to the package's maintainer group.</p>

<h2>Upgrading an account from old Hackage</h2>

<p>Accounts have been imported from the old Hackage server however a one-time upgrade is required. Use the <a href="/users/htpasswd-upgrade">account upgrade</a> page. (If you don't know your username, <a href="/users/">the complete list</a> may help.)</p>

<h2>Reset password</h2>

<p>If you forget your password you can <a href="/users/password-reset">reset it</a>
so long as you know your user login name and the email address you
originally registered with. The system will send you an email with a
link you can use to set a new password.</p>
