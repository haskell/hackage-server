# This file contains the project-specific settings for `fix-whitespace`
#
#   (get it with `cabal install fix-whitespace`)
#
# a tiny, but useful tool to:
#
# * Remove trailing whitespace.
# * Remove trailing lines containing nothing but whitespace.
# * Ensure that the file ends in a newline character.
#
# By default, fix-whitespace checks every directory under the current working
# directory but no files. This program should be placed under a text-based
# project.
#
# For directories,
#
# 1) excluded-dirs is a black-list of directories,
# 2) included-dirs is a white-list of excluded-dirs
#
# For files,
#
# 3) included-files is a white-list of files,
# 4) excluded-files is a black-list of included-files.
#
# The extended glob pattern can be used to specify file/direcotory names.
